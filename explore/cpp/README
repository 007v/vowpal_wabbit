   git remote add -f explore-cpp https://github.com/multiworldtesting/explore-cpp.git

2. Then use subtree command to pull from master branch of explore-cpp remote, and place it under explore/cpp directory:
   git subtree pull --prefix=explore/cpp/ explore-cpp master
   or alternatively:
   git pull -X subtree=explore/cpp explore-cpp master
