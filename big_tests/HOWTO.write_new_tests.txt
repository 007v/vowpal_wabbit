HOWTO write new tests for the big_tests test suite
--------------------------------------------------

The only variables that are required for every test are *.inData and *.params .  Everything else is optional.  Here's a simple example of a complete test specification:

myTest.inData := ftrl-proximal/ftrl-proximal-train.prep
myTest.params := -k -d $(dataDir)/$(107.inData) -f 0001_ftrl.model --passes 10 --ftrl --ftrl_alpha 0.01 --ftrl_beta 0 --l1 2 --cache --holdout_off
  
The data will typically be under dataSets/ .  Look at dataSets.mk for examples of how to add new datasets.

By default, STDOUT will go to the file out and STDERR will go to the file err. Other created files that should be compared to "expected" files should be captured by the *.otherOutputs variable.  For example:

myTest.otherOutputs := 0001_ftrl.model

These other expected files should be copied to the test's subdirectory under expected/ .

# If you're using an unusual executable (e.g. library_example), its path should be given by the *.exec variable, relative to the directory of the top level Makefile.  For example:

myTest.exec := $(TOP_MK_DIR)/../vowpalwabbit/library_example

List inter-test dependencies like this:

myTest.deps:	test2.run test4.test

Dependencies can be on any set of valid targets, including merely running other tests (*.run targets) or those tests actually passing (*.test targets).
