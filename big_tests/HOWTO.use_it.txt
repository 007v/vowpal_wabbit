Help file for using this testing framework
------------------------------------------

To run all the tests until one fails, type

make test

or simply

make

To run all the tests regardless of failures, type

make -i test

To clean up so that you can start over, type

make clean

To download all the relevant data at once, type

make getData

To erase all the data, type

make eraseData

If you change some code so that the output of some tests changes, or you add some new tests, and you want to save the new output so that future outputs will be compared with it, type

make expected

You can work with individual tests by prepending their name to the make target, as in

make 2.test
make t17.clean
make myNewTest.expected

Of course, you can make multiple targets together, as in

make 2.clean 2.test

There are also pre-defined groups of tests that you can run, such as

make regression_group

If you want to create the correct outputs for a test without actually running it, type

make $testName.pretend

This can be useful if you want to run test X, which depends on the outputs of test Y, but you can't run test Y for some reason.

The "test" target for each test is actually a "run" followed by a "compare".  Thus

make 3.run 3.compare

is equivalent to

make 3.test

and it's possible to invoke either part without the other.

If you want to use an executable other than ../vowpalwabbit/vw, you can supply it on the command line like this:

make EXEC=myProgram all

Similar substitutions can be made for other variables, such as ARCH and DIFF.

If you want to pass extra parameters to all tests, set the EP variable, like this:

make EP="--random_seed 13"
